// I thought i would make a function to draw only the contour of landmasses
// to reduce the amount of space occupied in the end result by the shallow water color to match more the source image
// turned out difficult
// first part identifying the different landmasses is done but it feel like spagetthi
// second part identifying non-shared edges sound even more trouble, for now it identify verteces only.
// While the previous is not done instead it just color the different landmasses in their own color.
// ideas for future => give landmasses proceduraly generated name, and try to write it as label using voronoi labeling Ã  la EUIV
// where am i going to write the name when the landmass look like a double donut ?
// maybe just take convex hull and show name only on hover ?
