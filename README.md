/!\I have no idea what i'm doing/!\

TL:DR=>  press "f" and click once on the background for the "full" thing now with lightning bolt and worms

You can access those tips by clicking on the question mark buttons

You can try to click the other buttons too , the button for fullscreen doesn't work, you should rather go to fullscreen first, and then refresh the page, because i haven't made it to resize nicely yet, it can only take the fullscreen when it's refreshed while already fullscreen. Some other buttons also have conflict with keys, it doesn't throw error but it shows there's still a lot of work. It's much faster than it used to be, but here too still lot of work.

pressing "a" and clicking add points 

pressing "z" and clicking smooth the graph

pressing "l" and clicking paint the map

pressing "r" and clicking a cell highlight its border and print its ID

(ALL keys works this way for now)

you can add obstacle by pressing "e" and clicking cells

you can turn all landmass or all water or remove all obstacle in cycle by pressing "j" and clicking 

you can hide the red overlay that highlight impassable terrain by pressing "k" and clicking

to test the pathfinder around those obstacles you can use key "o" "p" or "m" from fastest and dumbest, to slowest and finding the shortest path everytime

first click select a cell as origin, second one the destination, o make path stick to compare fastest to find and shortest

you can cycle through other overlay pressing "t" and clicking, blue is cell area, green perimeter, the other show number of neighboring cells

"h" is used to add randomly colored overlay over the different landmasses, this makes no sense to use if there is no "l" for color and "j" to turn some tile impassable active alredy

"Â²" will start playing background sound, wind, and i tried to find the driest thunder, but it still sound a bit like there's rain too.

"g" will start showing the day and night cycle for the planet , cells not impassable when activated have a little light shining now

if "u" is the first key activated, it removes all points, allowing only manually placed points to be visible

pressing "c" and clicking will regenerate the initial data cycling through different functions, untested if not used prior to the others /!\
