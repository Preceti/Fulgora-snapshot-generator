/!\I have no idea what i'm doing/!\

pressing "a" and clicking add points 

pressing "z" and clicking smooth the graph

pressing "l" and clicking paint the map

(ALL keys works this way for now)

you can add obstacle by pressing "e" and clicking cells

you can turn all landmass or all water or remove all obstacle in cycle by pressing "j" and clicking 

you can hide the red overlay that highlight impassable terrain by pressing "k" and clicking

to test the pathfinder around those obstacles you can use key "o" "p" or "m" from fastest and dumbest, to slowest and finding the shortest path everytime

first click select a cell as origin, second one the destination, o make path stick to compare fastest to find and shortest

you can cycle through other overlay pressing "t" and clicking, blue is cell area, green perimeter, the other show number of neighboring cells

"h" is used to add randomly colored overlay over the different landmasses, this makes no sense to use if there is no "l" for color and "j" to turn some tile impassable active alredy

"Â²" will start playing background sound, wind, and i tried to find the driest thunder, but it still sound a bit like there's rain too.

"g" will start showing the day and night cycle for the planet
