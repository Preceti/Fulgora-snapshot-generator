    Maybe this is visible, if no javascript was able to change it there is a problem, you shouldn't be reading this, that's not supposed to happen, or maybe the change was very slow ? but now this text is too long, it means you must be looking at the code or something is broken, if you are reading the code then have a good day, else if you are having trouble seeing the page i'm sorry, all i could do was to think of a stupid text to write. You can still try to have a good day hey !
